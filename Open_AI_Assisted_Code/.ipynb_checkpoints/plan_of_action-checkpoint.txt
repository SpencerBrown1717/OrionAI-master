since i am serious about building this system and helping local businesses, the first step is to start doing some research and planning. You'll need to figure out how to collect user data, what machine learning algorithms to use, how to design the rewards system, and so on.

Here are a few suggestions to help you get started:

1. Research existing recommendation engines and rewards systems: There are many existing systems out there that use machine learning and other techniques to make product recommendations and offer rewards to users. Look into some of these systems to see what works well and what doesn't, and use this knowledge to inform your own design.

2. Figure out how to collect user data: You'll need to gather data on users' online behavior in order to train the recommendation engine. There are many ways to do this, but you'll need to be careful to respect users' privacy and only collect data that they've explicitly consented to share.

3. Choose the right machine learning algorithms: There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for recommendation engines, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. You'll need to choose the right algorithms for your specific use case, and you may need to experiment with different techniques to find the best results.

4. Design the rewards system: The rewards system is a key part of the project, as it's what will incentivize users to engage with local businesses. You'll need to figure out what types of rewards to offer, how to track user engagement, and how to manage the rewards program in a way that's fair to everyone involved.

5. Build a prototype: Once you have a plan in place, start building a prototype of the system to test out your ideas and see what works well. You don't need to build the entire system at once, but it's important to start somewhere and iterate on your design as you go.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Building a system like this is a big undertaking, but it's certainly possible with the right planning and effort. Good luck!
